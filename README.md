## New things learned in this project
1. Tried Zustand for the first time. I liked it's simplicity and felt like a midway point between react context and redux. Would love to integrate it into future projects.
2. I had never done much dev in Tailwind CSS, but having used bootstrap in the past helped me grasp Tailwind fairly quickly.
