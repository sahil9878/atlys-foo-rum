## New things learned in this project
1. Tried Zustand for the first time. I liked it's simplicity and felt like a midway point between react context and redux. Would love to integrate it into future projects.
2. I had never done much dev in Tailwind CSS, but having used bootstrap in the past helped me grasp Tailwind fairly quickly.

## Notes/Future enhancements
1. I have not tried to make this mobile responsive as it will need some UX changes as well.
2. I have only limited the post interactions to "Like" for now.
3. For any new post, I am not using the username as author as we never collected the actual name in our flow.
4. I removed the email validations and type check as the text input said email or username, now just email
